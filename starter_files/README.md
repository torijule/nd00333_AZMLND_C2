# Your Project Title Here

*TODO:* 
This project was completed to satisfy requirements for the Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity.  I demonstrate registering a dataset, configuring an AutoML job, deploying a ML model, leveraging REST endpoints of said model from Azure Machine Learning Studio.  Using Python SDK in the attached notebook, I then create and publish a ML pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 
First I registered the required dataset.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
